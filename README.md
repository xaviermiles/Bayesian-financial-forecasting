# bayesian-financial-forecasting
Aim: to use Bayesian statistical models/methods to forecast NZ financial/economic data

This was originally done as the Honours-level project for a Bayesian Inference course (STAT461-20S2). The 'report' folder includes the (final) files from that course, and everything else has been developed since then.
