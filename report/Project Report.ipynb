    "The aim of this project is to investigate how Bayesian inference can be used in R to forecast time series data. The primary tool for this will be Bayesian linear regression and we will investigate using this model to predict the NZ GDP annual growth rate. The Bayesian approach is appealing because the priors can be used to impose restrictions/assumptions on the model, and this can help prevent overfitting, which is a common problem with time series data due to the number of parameters typically being large relative to the number of data points. The overfitting will not be such a concern when only using previous NZ GDP data, but becomes more important if other economic factors are included as explanatory variables."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Our forecast seems quite positive, with a mean predicted annual growth rate at around 3.2% by 2023.\n",
    "There seems to be a fair bit of upside risk with the upper bound of the 95% credible interval reaching nearly 4.5% by 2023.\n",
    "The graph indicates that it is highly unlikely that there will be negative NZ GDP growth over the next three years, with the lower bound of the 95% credible interval only just managing to avoid intersecting zero at it's lowest point. This is somewhat suprising considering how steeply the annual growth rate has been dropping in the last few periods and the generally pessimistic outlook of many people about prospects for the global economy over the next few years, but perhaps a (more complex) model which included other economic variables would forecast worse annual NZ GDP growth rates over the next few years."

    "Now we are going to investigate how the posterior inference and posterior predictions will change if we use a model that incorporates more information. The previous model just used the NZ GDP data for the two preceding quarters. This expanded model will also include Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Trade Weighted Index (TWI), where the CPI is an inflationary metric and the TWI measures the exchange rate of NZD to New Zealand's major trading partners.

    "We would expect GDP growth and CPI growth to move in opposite directions, since inflation (CPI) will often discourage spending within an economy and thus dampen economic output (GDP). We can see GDP and CPI moving in opposite directions in the early 1990s and during the 2000 recession. The relationship between GDP and TWI seems less obvious, but since the relative strength of the NZD (ie TWI) affects both exports and imports, it is expect to affect the NZ economy's aggregate demand (via expenditure approach) and thus impact on NZ GDP growth."

    "The forecasted values for CPI % change have a narrower confidence band than the forecasted values for GDP. From the plot, we can see that the CPI seems to have a less consistent trend over time, which would mean that the lagged CPI variables are not as strongly related to the current CPI variable. However, the BVAR model also uses lagged GDP and TWI variables to predict these CPI values, which means that CPI has a weaker relationship than GDP with all three of these lagged macroeconomic indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The forecasted values for TWI have an extremely wide confidence band, which means that we cannot have much confidence in the prediction.\n",
    "As a point estimate, we expect the TWI to be about 70 over the next three year-period, but the 95\\% credible interval spans from 60 to 80 by the end of 2023."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our forecast from the BVAR model still seems quite positive, and has fairly similar results to the BAR model, with an average predicted annual growth rate of around 3.2% by 2023. The major difference between the forecasts from both models is the confidence bands, which are slightly wider for the BVAR than the VAR model. This means that the revised predicted GDP growth has more downside and upside risk, and by 2023 the lower and upper bounds of the credible interval are 1% and 5%, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BVAR model does have it's 95% credible interval including zero at about 2020 Q3. \n",
    "Both of these models did not work well in practice, with the GDP growth rate for 2020 Q2 dropping to -2%. However, these models can only predict based on what are included and will not tend to forecast for unusual events, such as a global pandemic and recession.\n",
    "There was two large recessions in the training set, around 1999 Q4 and 2008 Q1, but the vector autoregressive recognises that these are not normal economic behaviour, and so will tend not to predict them in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "An improvement to this model might be to include a t-distribution for the error terms, as this is a more robust model and can better handle to unusual/extreme events. However, this might mean that model is not influenced as much by previous unusual events (ie recessions) and would therefore forecast that it is even less likely for zero or negative GDP growth to occur in the future three-year period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BVAR model could be extended to an arbitrary number of NZ economic measures (variables), with CPI growth and TWI being used in this project since there is the strongest theory for them to relate to the GDP growth. An alternative model could also include economic measures from other countries, such as the GDP growth in Australia, USA, and UK, as it would be expected that the economic condition/activity of New Zealand's trading partners is related to the economic condition/activity of New Zealand itself. This global model might pick up on economic trends that are occurring worldwide, but have not yet translated into changes in the NZ economy/GDP."
